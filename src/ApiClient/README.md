# API Client Library

This directory contains the API client library generated from the OpenAPI specification. The client library provides a set of classes and methods to interact with the API endpoints defined in the OpenAPI document.

## Installation

To use the API client library, add a reference to the `ApiClient` project in your solution. You can also package it as a NuGet package if needed.

## Usage

1. **Initialize the Client**: Create an instance of the API client.
   
   ```csharp
   var apiClient = new ApiClient("https://api.example.com");
   ```

2. **Make API Calls**: Use the generated methods to interact with the API.

   ```csharp
   var response = await apiClient.SomeEndpointAsync(parameters);
   ```

3. **Handle Responses**: Process the responses returned by the API methods.

## Examples

Refer to the generated classes in the `Generated` directory for specific examples of how to use each API endpoint.
