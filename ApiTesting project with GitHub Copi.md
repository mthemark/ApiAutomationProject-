ApiTesting project with GitHub Copilot
=

Prompt 1
-
/workspace I want to create set of C# projects the automates the testing on REST APIs. at least one project should be a xunit project to automate the testing of the REST API. A UI project similar to POSTMAN would be good to have but we can do that later.

Prompt 2
-
/workspace please remove the implementation of the API and include a Client Library that accesses the API based of a openapi secification, using https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator

Prompt 3
-
/workspace in the ApiClient project can you make a powershell script to generate the client code using the openapi.yaml file and the csharp generator documented here https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/blob/master/docs/generators/csharp.md

Developer Task 1
-
create generate-client.ps1 and generated implementation by typing the following comments below, 

``` text
# Detect if java is installed, with Get-Command java, if not, write-host warning
...GitHub Copilot generation...

# Ensure you have OpenAPI Generator by checking if openapi-generator-cli.jar exists in the current folder, please use Invoke-WebRequest to download the jar file
...GitHub Copilot generation...

# Generate the API client, by executing with java -jar
# Define paths for openapi.yaml and output directory
...GitHub Copilot generation...
```
the resulting file should be similar to below...
``` markdown
# Detect if java is installed, with Get-Command java, if not, write-host warning
